* DONE Add rules for atom.xml and archive.html to website

* DONE Change name from awkweb to puffin

* Make puffin documentation be an puffin website

* Make puffin manpages that also get converted into html using puffin as
part of the documentation

* Look into "Intermediate" targets in makefile for album targets

* Figure out how to have more config files for subdirs in content
Use case: photo albums, need to figure out how to spec a template
can use keyvals in rule to override target title

* DONE Change all reserved words to be _Capital, so RENDERERS becomes _Renderers

* Consider allowing custom _Renderer rules? 
This rule would copy jpg files
[content._Renderers]
jpg=cat 

* if Renderer is set to false, it doesn't copy

* DONE Use rule names to determine what directories to search
with sum of all applicable renderer rules used to decide which files
to include

Default renderer is not to copy. if you want to copy something, add it
to the renderer list
 
* DONE Need way of determining if renderer outputs html or some other format,
so we can allow other types of conversion. For example, jpegs should
be passed through without change, but markdown needs to turn into html
potentially, if renderer is set to cat, then don't change, but if
anything else, do change to html?

* Need wildcards for file extensions, so we can do *~=false to not pass
turds. maybe change this so renderers are based on entire file name
instead of just extension, so we can also use _*=false to exclude
draft posts? But draft vs nondraft shouldn't require rerunning puffin

* DONE Allow keys in rules to be used as template elements. so Title can be set
for a rule from the rule, not from the filename

* Add new keycommands for auto title and auto date, which are set for
default for page data type to encode that the name and date come from
filename

* Add new keycommands for item template vs template for blogroll?

* Abort templating if template is encountered that is not set

* DONE Write better function for aborting parsing

* Figure out how to configure that output goes into build directory

* Finish setup for puffin binary

* Add progress bar to makefile?

* Figure out way to quickly switch into draft mode, although I like the
idea above to use renderers to ignore draft files

* Clean up make file rendering using helper functions

* Figure out how to make more modular awk code. 

* Add tests

* DONE Make renderer take rule keyvals on command

* For renderering binary files, need way of specifying that file should
be included as filename in templates instead of file contents, since
we don't want to include jpgs in templates directly

* Template Language should support partials and arrays of elements

* get rid of blogroll: special list targets should be defined by requests

* use hierarchical rules that inherit from ones higher in hierarchy: so content/posts inherits all config from content.

* Add global rule for stuff at top of file that applies to all rules

* allow subdirectory ini files that only apply to the contents at that level or lower.

* need better way to determine conversion extensions, perhaps by hash? 

* add support for arrays in ini, by defining isarray function to check if key value is an array and converting it. consider adding hashes too

* add ignore file extension command

* use intermediate files to compile markdown before templating?

* DONE define layouts using default paths?, used default puffin.ini in lib dir

* describe how you would want a photo album rendererd in order to think
about how to implement it. Album dir would have custom puffin.ini with
individual rules for files. Each rule defines a key for the caption of
the photo. Have ordering determined by photo filename. images copied without transformation, but have index.html build from templates using titles in puffin.ini

* check if awk will allow arrays of arrays if you store them in an
intermediate value. if so, we can make nice adts and have a chance of implementing toml
foo[1]="a"
foo[2]="b"
foo[3]="c"
bar["foo"]=foo
baz=bar["foo"]
baz[1] # should be "a".. and it doesn't...

* implement pypuffin first using toml and mustache

* add option to specify external lib file with more functions for templating

* research limits of command line arguments

* List of metadata variables passed into templater
Title: The title of the file. Defaults to capitalized version of filename
Date: Defaults to date modified
Permalink: The permalink for the given file
Content: What was rendered for this file (only for page elements), empty for lists, lazily loaded from filename
Items: Array of values passed into templater, default sorted by date. Stored internally as numbered indexes in array

# hidden
num_Pages: count of Pages in array
filename = source file to get content

* DONE Fix titles

* TODO Add makefile rules so targets depend on their templates
** TODO Add function to get list of dependant templates
* DONE Figure out how to do working directory for templates
  CLOSED: [2017-05-13 Sat 16:22]
right now we assume we are in the top directory
* DONE Figure out how mustache is supposed to handle template filename extensions
  CLOSED: [2017-05-13 Sat 16:22]
According to standard, don't include extension in template, but assume a specific extension.
You can specify paths, but they need to be relative to the template that is being parsed. 

Additionally, check the rules table before reading a file, so that templates can be specified in parameters
 
* DONE Add html escaping
  CLOSED: [2017-05-13 Sat 12:54]
* DONE change error writing to use  | "cat 1>&2"

* TODO Refactor puffin so that action type is extendable
It would be nice if we could create new actions that are local to a
specific website. We could change the way puffin renders pages so that it is broken up by action, and then allow new actions to be defined in local awk scripts

* DONE Add helper command to dump rules for a given file
